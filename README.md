# OCTA_microangiogram_properties

To use this code, reconstruct your microangiogram data and save it as a .mat file. Do not apply a log transformation at this stage. Once ready, follow the steps in "Capillary_graphing.mlx". When this is completed, run "Make_figures.mlx" to obtain figures like the one presented in the manuscript.
