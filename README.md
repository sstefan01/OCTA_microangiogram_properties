# OCTA_microangiogram_properties

To use this code, open the file Capillary_graphing.mlx and follow the instructions. This live script is for processing of data. To produce figures like the ones in the manuscript, run Make_Figures.mlx. Example datasets are included: micro.mat and intensity_example.mat. These must be unzipped first. The dataset micro.mat is a cropped version of the angiogram in the manuscript (the original was too large to include without cropping).
